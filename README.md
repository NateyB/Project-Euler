# Project Euler
My solutions to Project Euler problems. Do not look at a problem's solution
if you have not already solved the problem yourself!

Most of my solutions are implemented in Haskell, as gaining proficiency in
Haskell is one of the goals of my attempting these problems. Not all problems
are; however, for the time being these solutions are considered bugs.
